## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying sonar signals to distinguish between rocks and mines. The objective is to build an accurate classification model using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Efficient classification of sonar signals.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model comparison and evaluation for optimal performance.

## Dataset
- **Description**:
  - 60 attributes representing sonar signal strengths at different angles.
  - Labels: "R" (Rock) and "M" (Mine).

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Modeling
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Scale features using standardization.
2. **Model Selection**:
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, etc.
   - Perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Metrics: Accuracy.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **79%** on the test set.
